# odin-tictactoe
This project is about making a basic tictactoe game, playable on command line and built with ruby. And also to get some practice with OOP principles.



I know TheOdinProject has a chess game as a project later on, so my goal is to have a base Game class with 2 player variables that i could use in multiple games and a seperate GameLogic class(es).
